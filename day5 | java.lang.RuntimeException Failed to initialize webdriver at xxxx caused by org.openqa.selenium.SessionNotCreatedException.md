**Question**: What could be the possible reason for the following error 
  java.lang.RuntimeException Failed to initialize webdriver at xxxx caused by org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: 
  Could not start a new session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser start-up failure.
**Answer**:   
In this scenario, we were facing this issue when working on Web Test Automation and we run our test scripts on BrowserStack Automate. 
And the reason for this Exception was that the firewall in the network which was blocking the call to the BrowserStack.
